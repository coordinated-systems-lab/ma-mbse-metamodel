  # The ConstraintDefinition entity captures the definition of the parametric
  # constraint as an Expression, identifying the independent variable(s) and the
  # dependent variable in the definition.
  constraintDefinitions: [ConstraintDefinition]

  # A defined term identifies a word, phrase, or acronym used in a document. The
  # formal documentation scripts treat the entity name as the acronym meaning or the
  # term, Acronym as the acronym, and Description as the term definition.
  definedTerms: [DefinedTerm]

  # A document identifies either the source/authorization for information entered
  # into the system description database, a specification/document generated from
  # the contents of the database, or an applicable or reference document for a
  # specification/document generated from the contents of the database.

  # structure.

  # mission, loss of reputation, loss or leak of sensitive information, or any other
  # loss that is unacceptable to the stakeholders.
  losses: [Loss]

  # A loss scenario describes the causal factors that can lead to the unsafe control
  # and to hazards.    Two types of loss scenarios must be considered:  a) Why would
  # Unsafe Control Actions occur?  b) Why would control actions be improperly
  # executed or not executed, leading to hazards?
  lossScenarios: [LossScenario]

  # documentation for a system, a refinement of a higher-level requirement, a
  # derived characteristic of the system or one of its subcomponents, or a design

  # external file content in a document following the description of the augmented
  # entity.
  texts: [Text]

  # Transition is the process or period of changing from one state or condition to
  # another.
  transitions: [Transition]

  # An Unsafe Control Action (UCA) is a control action that, in a particular context
  # and worst-case environment, will lead to a hazard.
  unsafeActions: [UnsafeAction]

  # A use case entity identifies a piece of the functionality of a system in terms
  # of how the users use the system to achieve their goals. Use cases are high-level
  # descriptions of behavior under a specific set of conditions. These high-level
  # descriptions can then be elaborated to define the system behavior.
